<h1>Project description</h1>

MovinList is an app that helps people furnish their homes. In MovinList, users can register the rooms of the house, and for each room, they can create a list of products (furniture, appliances, etc.) 
that need to be purchased.

In addition, users can mark which products on their list have already been acquired. It's possible to track financial expenses for both purchased and pending items.

Another interesting feature is that MovinList can be accessed from multiple devices simultaneously, allowing professionals such as architects or interior designers to collaborate with their clients in furnishing the home.
